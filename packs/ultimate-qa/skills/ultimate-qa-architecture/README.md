# Ultimate QA Architecture

Assess architecture ownership, coupling and maintainability through representative user journeys.

## Install

### Direct install with npx (recommended)

No manual clone, ZIP download, or Python checkout is required to install this skill. The external CLI obtains the published source for you.

Prerequisites: [Node.js 22.20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) with npm/npx, network access to npm/GitHub, and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for repository fallback. If a command is missing, install that prerequisite and reopen the terminal. These are installer prerequisites; the skill's runtime requirements are listed separately below.

PowerShell, from any folder, check tools first:

```powershell
node --version
npm --version
npx --version
git --version
```

PowerShell: replace `D:\My App` with your existing target application, then run each line separately:

```powershell
Set-Location 'D:\My App'
npx skills@1.7.4 add https://github.com/Etriii/agent-skills --skill ultimate-qa-architecture --agent codex claude-code --copy
```

This selects only `ultimate-qa-architecture` for Codex and Claude Code in the current project. Review the selected source, agents, scope and destinations in the CLI summary. npm may ask to download the pinned CLI; the skill installer may also prompt. These examples do not force noninteractive approval.

Still in the application folder, confirm the project copies:

```powershell
Test-Path '.agents/skills/ultimate-qa-architecture/SKILL.md'
Test-Path '.claude/skills/ultimate-qa-architecture/SKILL.md'
```

Both should return `True` for the two-agent project install. Refresh the coding-agent session, then use the chat requests in this README. Installation copies instructions; it does not run the skill.

For one agent, replace `--agent codex claude-code` with `--agent codex` or `--agent claude-code`. For an intended global installation across projects, choose this alternative command after the same prerequisites; do not run both scope examples unless you want both copies:

```powershell
npx skills@1.7.4 add https://github.com/Etriii/agent-skills --skill ultimate-qa-architecture --agent codex claude-code -g --copy
```

Global destinations are shown by the CLI; the project-relative `Test-Path` checks above do not verify global copies. Remote URLs install published files, so local unpushed changes are not included. PowerShell execution-policy errors can use `npx.cmd` instead of `npx`; see [troubleshooting](../../../../docs/NPX_INSTALLATION.md#troubleshooting) for missing tools, names, network access and refresh issues.

### Optional recorded or offline installation with Python

Keep this route when you want manifest verification, retained backups and Markdown operation history. It requires Python 3.11+ and a **complete local collection** first. Follow [download/extract or clone steps](../../../../INSTALL.md#optional-local-copy-for-python-and-offline-use), then identify the root containing `tools/`, `packs/`, and `README.md`. `tools/install_skills.py` is a file in that root, not a global command.

PowerShell: replace `D:\Tools\agent-skills` with that actual collection root and `D:\My App` with the existing destination application. For a ZIP, the extracted root may instead end in `agent-skills-main`.

```powershell
Set-Location 'D:\Tools\agent-skills'
python --version
python tools/install_skills.py --pack ultimate-qa --agent both --project "D:\My App" --skills ultimate-qa-architecture --dry-run
python tools/install_skills.py --pack ultimate-qa --agent both --project "D:\My App" --skills ultimate-qa-architecture
```

The first installer command previews and writes nothing. The second requests the existing confirmation and performs the copy with operation records. Run them separately. Python uses `--agent both`; npx uses `--agent codex claude-code`. For Python-only Codex or Claude choose `--agent codex` or `--agent claude`. User-scope options are in the [installation guide](../../../../INSTALL.md#choose-a-pack-agent-and-scope).

Use the installer that owns an existing copy for updates/removal; npx and Python maintain different records and protections. Preserve local edits before replacement. See the [pack guide](../../README.md), [npx lifecycle](../../../../docs/NPX_INSTALLATION.md#updates-and-removal), and [recorded removal guide](../../../../UNINSTALL.md).

## Use

Refresh the agent session, open the target application repository, and invoke this in agent chat:

```text
$ultimate-qa-architecture Trace the request approval journey from UI through persistence. Distinguish confirmed defects from maintainability risks.
```

In Claude Code use `/ultimate-qa-architecture`. These are agent chat instructions, not terminal commands. For versioned reports integrated with the core workflow, also install `ultimate-qa` and invoke `$ultimate-qa run`.

## Expected result and stopping point

Expect source-linked journey findings, evidence-supported dimension scores, and a risk/dependency-ordered repair recommendation. Unassessed dimensions remain blank; the review does not refactor the application.

Supply the target application, selected journeys/endpoints and authorized test environment in the request or conversation. This specialist accepts natural-language scope; it defines no generic `run`, `build` or `--auto` mode. When a current QA version exists, evidence belongs to that review. A standalone review does not silently create a complete versioned QA run.

## Prerequisites and limits

Needs application source and available tests/static analysis. The skill includes [architecture checks](references/checks.md); no full QA kit is required for a standalone source review.

Support findings with concrete source locations. Do not prescribe a framework or score an unassessed dimension.

Read the full [agent instructions](SKILL.md), [recorded installation guide](../../../../INSTALL.md), and [npx update/removal guide](../../../../docs/NPX_INSTALLATION.md#updates-and-removal). Use the installer that owns the copy for updates and removal. [Contribute](../../../../CONTRIBUTING.md).
