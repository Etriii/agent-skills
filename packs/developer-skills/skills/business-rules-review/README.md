# Business Rules Review

Map workflow rules to authoritative policy, server enforcement and boundary cases.

## Install

Install globally for Codex with Node.js 22.20+ and npm:

```powershell
npx skills@1.7.4 add https://github.com/Etriii/agent-skills --skill business-rules-review --agent codex -g --copy
```

For a project install, run from the application directory and omit `-g`. For Claude Code, use `--agent claude-code`. Review the displayed destinations before proceeding.

For installation with checksums, retained backups and Markdown records, use Python 3.11+ from the downloaded collection root:

```powershell
python tools/install_skills.py --pack developer-skills --agent codex --project "D:\My App" --skills business-rules-review --dry-run
python tools/install_skills.py --pack developer-skills --agent codex --project "D:\My App" --skills business-rules-review
```

To install all related skills, follow the [Developer Skills pack guide](../../README.md).

## Use

Refresh the agent session, open the target application, and invoke this in agent chat:

```text
$business-rules-review Review the approval workflow, including existing approved records, cancellation and role boundaries.
```

In Claude Code use `/business-rules-review`. These are agent chat instructions, not terminal commands.

## Prerequisites and limits

Provide policy sources, workflow states and representative records. Missing policy needs an authorized decision rather than inference from UI fields.

The skill itself needs no private runner, API key or third-party runtime package. It uses the target repository's existing tools where the requested checks require them. Installing instructions does not execute them or prove model adherence.

Read the complete [agent instructions](SKILL.md), [installation options](../../../../INSTALL.md), and [npx update/removal guide](../../../../docs/NPX_INSTALLATION.md#updates-and-removal). Use the installer that owns the copy for updates and removal. [Contribute](../../../../CONTRIBUTING.md).
